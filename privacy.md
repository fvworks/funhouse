# Fun House Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and
the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

## The Information We Collect

Any information gathered by us is used to customize the experience for you the user, and is not shared or sold to any third parties,
except as expressly provided for in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. 

## Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy, we use industry standard methods to safeguard and secure the information
we collect online, although you recognize that data transmitted online or stored in a facility to which online access is provided 
cannot be made to be 100% secure. We believe in protecting your information just as we would want our information protected.

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons 
whose personal information has been compromised as may be required by applicable law.

Please note that information you enter for your user profile or in your posts may be accessed and viewed publicly and 
therefore you should not post information that you consider confidential or that you do not want distributed publicly. 
Although in some areas you will have the ability to edit or delete information, please note that even this information 
may have been cached on servers, cut and pasted or otherwise incorporated into other posts or for other uses, 
and so once information is posted you should consider that it may be publicly available perpetually, 
and in different locations and/or media than your original submission.

## Notifications

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, 
to our users via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice via the Fun House app, 
as determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing 
notifications to our users.

## Child Protection

In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13 
from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts.

## How You Can Access or Correct Your Information

You can access your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in and "Editing" your account. 
Your password is needed to edit this information, even if you are already logged in. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 
You may not be able to edit or delete past entries and information collected regarding past updates.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 
The main form of identity management is your email address. Please always use a valid and up-to-date email address.

## Use of User Information

Information you provide to us about yourself, or that we collect and infer based upon your entries inside the Fun House app may be used to 
improve your user experience, provide or suggest targeted services and to allow third party advertises and messaging to be tailored or targeted. 
We may use or provide to third parties aggregated data entered by users or inferred from usage. 
We may collect IP addresses and cookies for the primary purpose of assisting with ease of use by you. 
However, except as legally required, we will not sell or provide your email address, IP address, cookies, address or phone number to
